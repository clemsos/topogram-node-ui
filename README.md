# Topogram UI

``Topogram UI`` is an engine to visualize spread of information using data from social network services. 

This project is evolved from a phD research by [Cl√©ment Renaud](http://clementrenaud.com) about memes on the Chinese social network **Sina Weibo**. Read the [phD thesis (in French)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2fbqjk2d90josg5/thesis.pdf) or have a look at the [experimental version of the code](http://github.com/clemsos/mitras).


## Install

The stack for the UI is based on node / angular / d3.js

    # node should be installed
    nvm install v0.10.26
    npm install
    npm -g install bower supervisor forever zerorpc
    bower install
